#Traffic Light simulation

This is the source code for the simulation made for ASE. \
It uses the monogames 3.8 framework and websocketsharp 1.0.3.

Textures are from kenney \
https://www.kenney.nl/

The simulation uses a giant observer pattern in order to keep track of all the 'prefabs'. \
It also uses a custom lightweight pattern to keep memory usage low by keeping only one instance of each texture in memory.
